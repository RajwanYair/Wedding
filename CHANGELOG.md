# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — Phase 1 Foundations (v5.0 prep)

- **F1.1 Break up god module**: Extract 5 handler modules from main.js → `src/handlers/` (guest, table, vendor, section, settings). Create `src/core/constants.js` (single source of truth for sections). Create `src/utils/form-helpers.js` (shared `openAddModal` + `getVal`). main.js reduced from 1,720 → 707 lines (59% reduction).
- **F1.2 Partial js/ deprecation**: Migrate `js/i18n/*.json` → `src/i18n/`. Update inject-config.mjs to only patch `src/core/config.js`. Remove `js/` from tsconfig and vite coverage. Update CI security scan to scan `src/` instead of `js/`.
- **F1.3 Type safety**: Create `src/types.d.ts` with 11 shared interfaces (Guest, Table, Vendor, Expense, etc.). Update `tsconfig.json` to include `src/**/*.js` and `src/**/*.d.ts`.
- **F1.4 Template auto-discovery**: Replace hardcoded `_loaders` map with `import.meta.glob("../templates/*.html")` in template-loader.js.
- **F1.5 Error resilience**: Wrap all 4 event dispatch paths in events.js with try-catch. Add `beforeunload` flush in store.js. Add console.warn on localStorage quota errors.
- **F1.6 Lazy section JS**: Replace 19 static section imports with `import.meta.glob("./sections/*.js")` + cached `_resolveSection()`. Add `_SECTION_ALIASES` for filename-to-section-ID mapping.

## [3.8.3] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Two-way Google Sheets sync** — `pullAllFromSheetsImpl()` reads all 6 tabs via GViz and merges into local store; `pullFromSheets()` button added to Settings under Google Sheets actions.
- **Timeline tab synced** — `src/sections/timeline.js` now calls `enqueueWrite("timeline", ...)` on save/delete; `SHEETS_TIMELINE_TAB` added to `src/core/config.js`.
- **Config sheet key uniqueness** — GAS v2.1.0: `replaceAll` deduplicates incoming Config rows by key; new `cleanConfig` action deduplicates the sheet in-place. Button “🧹 נקה מפתחות כפולים” added to Settings.
- **Config sheet always complete** — `_WEDDING_INFO_KEYS` canonical list in `sheets-impl.js` guarantees all 14 `weddingInfo` keys are pushed to the Config tab with empty strings for unset fields; `_defaultWeddingInfo` in `main.js` expanded accordingly.
- **Push All to Sheets** — `pushAllToSheetsImpl()` force-syncs all 6 stores (header row + data) regardless of write queue; button “📤 שלח הכל ל-Google Sheets” added to Settings.
- **PWA install prompt** — `initInstallPrompt()` in `src/core/ui.js` listens for `beforeinstallprompt`, defers it, and shows a slide-up banner after 30 s inviting browser users to install the app; dismissal snoozed 30 days in `localStorage`.

### Changed

- `js/config.js`, `src/core/config.js`, `public/sw.js` — version bumped to v3.8.3.
- Cache bust: `CACHE_NAME` bumped to `wedding-v3.8.3` in `public/sw.js`.

### Fixed

- **Hebrew "Find Your Table" translation** — corrected `tableFinder` i18n key in `js/i18n/he.json` to display proper Hebrew text.
- **Email login selector** — `#adminLoginEmail` selector mismatch in `src/services/auth.js` caused email input not to be found; now resolves correctly.

### Changed

## [3.8.1] — 2026-04-15

### Added

Shows a dismissible top banner (`showUpdateBanner()`) prompting users to refresh; auto-reloads silently if the page has been open ≥ 5 minutes.
- **`showUpdateBanner()` / `applyUpdate()`** — New exports in `src/core/ui.js`; wired in `src/main.js` bootstrap.
- Cache bust: `CACHE_NAME` bumped to `wedding-v3.8.1` in `public/sw.js`.

### Fixed

- **Guest landing page** — Guests now land on the `landing` section (couple names, date, venue) instead of the bare RSVP form. `updateTopBar()` + `updateCountdown()` called at bootstrap so header shows wedding info immediately before any section mounts.
- **Sign-out** — Signs out to `landing` (was `rsvp`); unreachable non-public sections silently redirect to `landing`.
- **Admin emails** — Added `anat.rajwan@gmail.com` to default `ADMIN_EMAILS` in both `src/core/config.js` and `js/config.js` (was misspelled as `anar`).

## [3.8.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added

- **`appendToRsvpLog(entry)`** — New export in `src/services/sheets.js`; posts an RSVP submission row (timestamp, phone, name, status, count) to the `RSVP_Log` sheet tab, replacing the previous no-op `() => Promise.resolve()` placeholder.

- **`announce(message, politeness?)`** — New a11y export in `src/core/ui.js`; creates/updates a `#ariaLiveRegion` div with `aria-live` for screen reader announcements. Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to force re-announcement of identical messages.
- **WhatsApp char counter** — `updateWaPreview()` in `src/sections/whatsapp.js` now updates a `#waCharCount` element with current length / 4096 and characters remaining. Adds CSS class `wa-char-warn` when fewer than 200 characters remain.

- **Regression tests in `tests/wedding.test.mjs`** — 7 new describe blocks covering all v3.8.0 source-level changes.

### Fixed

- RSVP log write was a no-op (`enqueueWrite("rsvp", () => Promise.resolve())`). Fixed to call `appendToRsvpLog` with real RSVP data.

- **v3.6.0 regression tests** — 29 new tests in `tests/wedding.test.mjs` covering all new features.

### Changed

- **`package.json`** — version `3.5.0` → `3.6.0`; added `"postbuild": "node scripts/generate-precache.mjs"`.
- **`public/sw.js`** — `CACHE_NAME` updated from `wedding-v3.5.0` to `wedding-v3.6.0`.
- **`js/config.js`** — version comment updated to v3.6.0.

## [3.5.0] — 2026-08-01

### Added

- **S2.6 IntersectionObserver stat counters** — `initStatCounterObserver()` in `src/sections/dashboard.js` animates `.stat-value` / `.stat-number` elements from 0 to their current value when they scroll into view (600ms ease-out cubic). Disconnects on section unmount.
- **S2.8 Pull-to-refresh** — `initPullToRefresh(onRefresh)` in `src/core/nav.js`; CSS body classes `ptr--pulling` / `ptr--refreshing` with animated indicator; wired to `syncSheetsNow()` in `src/main.js` bootstrap.
- **S3.4 Conflict resolution** — `mergeLastWriteWins(local, remote)` exported from `src/services/sheets.js`; last `updatedAt` wins; local-only records are preserved.
- **S3.8 Vendor/Expense/Guest/Table/Settings sync** — replaced no-op `() => Promise.resolve()` callbacks in all data sections with `() => syncStoreKeyToSheets(key)`. Also added `syncStoreKeyToSheets(storeKey)` helper to `sheets.js` that POSTs `replaceAll` action to the GAS backend.
- **S4.6 Gallery lazy loading** — gallery thumbnail images already had `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"`; lightbox image now also uses `decoding="async"` for off-main-thread decode.
- **A11y skip-to-main link (S7.9)** — first child of `<body>` in `index.html`; keyboard-visible only (offscreen by default, shown on focus); `data-i18n="skip_to_main"`.
- **i18n: new keys** — `rsvp_deadline_soon`, `rsvp_deadline_passed`, `skip_to_main`, `ptr_release_to_refresh`, `ptr_refreshing` in both `he.json` and `en.json`.
- **CSS: `.skip-to-main`** — accessible skip link styles in `components.css`.
- **CSS: pull-to-refresh indicator** — `body.ptr--pulling::before` / `body.ptr--refreshing::before` pseudoelement spinner; `@keyframes spinCW`.
- **Unit tests (S6.2–S6.6)** — 4 new test files: `tests/unit/utils.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/store.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/sheets.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/auth.test.mjs` covering phone/date/sanitize/misc utils, reactive store, sheets sync + conflict resolution, and auth session logic.
- **v3.5.0 regression tests** — 28 new tests in `tests/wedding.test.mjs` covering all new features.
- **CI version updated** to v3.5.0.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed (Critical Bug Fixes)

- **WhatsApp bulk-send ignores filter arg**: `sendWhatsAppAll()` now accepts `filter` parameter (`"pending"` sends only un-sent pending guests, `"all"` sends everyone except declined). Both `window.open` and Green API paths respect the filter.
- **WhatsApp sent state not tracked**: Added `markGuestSent(id)` — sets `guest.sent = true` + `sentAt` timestamp in the store. Called on every link click and API send. Sent badge shown in guest row.
- **`updateWaPreview` not wired**: Added `export function updateWaPreview(template, guest)` to whatsapp.js; wires template textarea changes to the preview bubble and time display.
- **`saveTransportSettings` used FormData**: Rewrote to read each transport input by element ID (`transportEnabled`, `transportTefachotTime`, etc.) directly — no `<form>` wrapper required.
- **`addApprovedEmail` used wrong ID**: Fixed typo `approvedEmail` → `newApproveEmail` (the actual input ID in settings.html).
- **`addRegistryLink` used form.querySelector**: Fixed to read `registryInputUrl` and `registryInputName` by ID — template uses IDs, not `name` attributes.
- **Gallery upload never fired**: Added `data-on-change` delegation to `src/core/events.js` — file inputs with `data-on-change="handleGalleryUpload"` now reliably dispatch through the event hub.
- **`data-on-enter` never fired**: Added `keydown` Enter delegation to `src/core/events.js` — inputs with `data-on-enter="addApprovedEmail"` (etc.) now fire on Enter.
- **Gallery admin bar never shown**: `gallery.js mount()` now reads auth session and shows `#galleryAdminBar` for authenticated, non-anonymous users.
- **Gallery missing delete buttons**: `renderGallery()` now appends a delete button per photo for admin users (calls `deleteGalleryPhoto` handler).
- **Gallery missing lightbox**: Added `openLightbox(id)` — creates fullscreen overlay with keyboard ESC + click-outside dismissal.
- **Green API status element missing**: Added `<p id="greenApiStatus">` to `settings.html` after the "Test Connection" button.
- **`template-loader.js` missing registry/guest-landing**: Added loaders for `registry.html` and `guest-landing.html` so lazy template injection works for those sections.

### Added

- **`updateRsvpDeadlineBanner()`** in `dashboard.js` — reads `weddingInfo.rsvpDeadline`, shows amber banner when ≤ 7 days remain, red banner when deadline has passed.
- **Sync status badge** — `#syncStatusBadge` span added to the top bar in `index.html`; wired to `onSyncStatus()` callback from `src/services/sheets.js`; shows Syncing / Synced / Error states with appropriate colors.
- **Exponential backoff for Sheets writes** — `src/services/sheets.js` `_flush()` now retries failed writes up to `_MAX_RETRIES = 4` times with jittered exponential delay (base `_BACKOFF_BASE_MS = 2000 ms`). Gives up and sets status `"error"` after all retries exhausted. Resets to `"idle"` 3 seconds after a successful sync.
- **`color-scheme: dark light`** declared in `css/variables.css :root` for better system-theme integration.
- **`.sync-badge` CSS** with `--syncing`, `--synced`, `--error` modifier classes (amber/green/red).
- **`.rsvp-deadline-banner--late` / `--soon` CSS** modifiers for deadline banner coloring.
- **45 new regression tests** for all v3.4.0 fixes (events delegation, gallery, WhatsApp, settings, sheets backoff, dashboard deadline, sync badge, CSS, template-loader).

## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed (Critical Bug Fixes)

- **RSVP form never populated**: `_prefillForm()` used wrong element IDs (`rsvp-phone` → `rsvpPhone`, `rsvp-count` → `rsvpGuests`, etc.) and revealed wrong element (`rsvpFormBody` → `rsvpDetails`)
- **RSVP confirmation never shown**: `_showConfirmation()` targeted `rsvpConfirmMessage` which didn't exist; replaced with new `#rsvpConfirm` div added to `rsvp.html`; `"maybe"` status now handled
- **Analytics charts blank**: Template had `analyticsSideChart`/`analyticsMealChart` but JS rendered to `analyticsSideDonut`/`analyticsMealBar` — IDs unified across template and JS
- **Dashboard groom/bride/transport stats always 0**: Added the three missing calculations and `_setText` calls
- **Language toggle broken**: `switchLanguage()` called with no argument — now passes the toggled locale string
- **Invitation form changes never saved**: `on("updateWeddingDetails", ...)` was not registered; `renderInvitation()` now populates all form fields from store on mount
- **Contact form always failed**: Wrong show/hide element IDs (`contactForm` → `contactFormFields`, `contactSuccess` → `contactFormSuccess`); `on("submitContactForm", ...)` was not registered
- **Budget target save broken**: `saveBudgetTarget` handler passed the `<form>` element to `saveBudgetEntry()` instead of reading input value
- **Budget stat boxes always 0**: Stat elements (`budgetStatGifts`, `budgetStatTotal`, etc.) were never populated
- **Budget progress bar always hidden**: Progress wrap never shown even when budget target was set
- **Tables unassigned-guests list empty**: `renderTables()` never wrote into `#unassignedGuests`
- **Settings `populateSettings()` broken**: Used `setting-groom` / `setting-bride` IDs that don't exist; rewritten to call `updateDataSummary()` + `sheetsWebAppUrl` + approved-emails render
- **Settings CSV import never fired**: Template used `data-on-change="importCSV"` but handler is `importGuestsCSV`
- **Settings `saveWebAppUrl` wrong ID**: Looked for `settingWebAppUrl` — corrected to `sheetsWebAppUrl`
- **Landing couple-name wrong ID**: `landingCouple` → `landingCoupleName`; also wired `landingHebrewDate`, `landingAddress`, `landingVenue`, `landingWazeLink`, `landingTimeline`, `landingRegistrySection`
- **Check-in showed raw UUID for table**: `renderCheckin()` now resolves `g.tableId` to `table.name` from the tables store

### Added

- **`wa_default_template` i18n key** — default WhatsApp message template (Hebrew + English)
- **30+ missing i18n keys**: `rsvp_confirmed`, `rsvp_declined`, `language_switched`, `contact_sent`, `error_green_api_config`, `green_api_connected`, `green_api_not_connected`, `error_network`, `analytics_meal_summary_title`, `no_approved_emails`, `all_guests_seated`, `count`, `your_table`, `error_invalid_amount`, `chart`, `send_whatsapp`, `other`, `groom_placeholder`, `bride_placeholder`, `wedding_past`, `wedding_today`, `days_until_wedding`, `registry_subtitle`, `registry_empty`, `guest_landing_title`, `guest_landing_greeting`, `rsvp_status_label`, `table_tbd` (both `he.json` and `en.json`)
- **`src/templates/registry.html`** — guest-facing registry links template
- **`src/templates/guest-landing.html`** — personalised guest invitation landing template
- **Analytics headcount stats + meal summary**: `renderAnalytics()` now fills `analyticsHeadAdults/Children/Total/Confirmed/Access`, renders sent/unsent donut, and renders catering meal summary

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed (Critical Bug Fixes)

- **Modal saves never worked**: All 5 modal HTML files lacked `<form>` tags so `FormData` always returned empty. Rewrote all save handlers in `src/main.js` to read values from DOM element IDs directly (`saveGuest`, `saveTable`, `saveVendor`, `saveExpense`, `saveTimelineItem`)
- **Hebrew i18n always empty**: `src/main.js` bootstrap only called `loadLocale()` for English — Hebrew users saw raw key names everywhere. Fixed to always `await loadLocale(lang)`
- **`sortGuestsBy` never worked**: Handler read `el.dataset.field` but template uses `data-action-arg`. Fixed to `el.dataset.actionArg`
- **Table/div rendering in `<tbody>`**: `renderVendors()`, `renderExpenses()`, `renderCheckin()` were appending `<div>` elements into `<tbody>` — browsers silently discard invalid HTML. Rewrote all three to generate `<tr><td>` rows
- **budget.js subscriptions missing**: `mount()` never subscribed to `expenses`/`vendors` store changes, so `renderBudgetProgress()` never updated automatically
- **QR code element ID mismatch**: `settings.js` targeted `#rsvpQrCode` but template has `#rsvpQrImage`
- **SW install failure**: `invitation.jpg` in APP_SHELL caused SW to fail offline install if the file was missing. Removed; kept `icon-192.png` + `icon-512.png`
- **`input` events never delegated**: `src/core/events.js` had no `data-on-input` delegation. Added listener
- **Event name mismatches**: `data-on-input="filterGuests"` → `searchGuests`; `data-on-input="searchCheckin"` → `checkinSearch`

### Added

- **Edit modals for all entities**: `openGuestForEdit()`, `openVendorForEdit()`, `openExpenseForEdit()`, `openTableForEdit()`, `openTimelineForEdit()` — pre-fill modal fields for in-place editing
- **Delete handlers for tables + timeline**: `on("deleteTable", ...)` and `on("deleteTimelineItem", ...)` with confirmation dialog
- **`lookupRsvpByPhone` handler**: Wired phone input `data-on-input` to RSVP phone-first lookup flow
- **Hidden ID fields in all modals**: Added `<input type="hidden" id="xxxModalId">` to all 5 modal HTML files to track create vs. edit mode
- **Edit/delete buttons in all list renders**: `renderGuests()`, `renderVendors()`, `renderExpenses()`, `renderTimeline()`, `renderTables()` now include per-row/per-card action buttons
- **`analyticsBudgetBar` container**: Added missing `<div id="analyticsBudgetBar">` to `analytics.html` for `renderBudgetChart()` to target
- **`budgetProgressLabel`**: Added `<span id="budgetProgressLabel">` to `budget.html`; budget.js auto-generates QR on `mount()`
- **40+ new i18n keys**: Added `saved`, `syncing`, `synced`, `error_save`, `guest_saved`, `table_saved`, `vendor_saved`, `expense_saved`, `confirm_clear_all`, `auth_welcome`, `auth_signed_out`, `sheets_connected`, `sheets_not_connected`, `settings_saved`, and more to both `he.json` and `en.json`
- **`openAddXModal` clears hidden ID**: All "Add New" modal openers now reset the hidden `id` field so saves create new records instead of overwriting

### Tests

- Version checks updated to v3.2.0 — **965 tests, 97+ suites**

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- `importGuestsCSV()` in `src/sections/guests.js` — parse and bulk-import guests from CSV (columns: FirstName/LastName/Phone/Email/Count/Children/Status/Side/Group/Meal/Notes); updates existing guests by phone
- `exportExpensesCSV()` + `filterExpensesByCategory()` in `expenses.js`
- `exportVendorsCSV()` + `filterVendorsByCategory()` in `vendors.js`
- `exportCheckinReport()` + `resetAllCheckins()` in `checkin.js`
- `renderBudgetChart()` in `analytics.js` — SVG bar chart of expenses by category + vendor total; auto-updates on expenses/vendors store changes
- `renderBudgetProgress()` in `budget.js` — progress bar showing spent vs. `weddingInfo.budgetTarget`
- `buildWhatsAppMessage(guestId, template?)` in `whatsapp.js` — returns `{ message, link }` preview without opening a window
- `generateRsvpQrCode()` in `settings.js` — renders QR code via qrserver.com API into `#rsvpQrCode` img element
- `showConfirmDialog(message, onConfirm)` in `src/core/ui.js` — callback-based confirm wrapper

### Changed

- `src/main.js` — registered 11 new data-action handlers: `deleteGuest`, `deleteVendor`, `deleteExpense`, `deleteBudgetEntry`, `checkInGuest`, `checkinSearch`, `importGuestsCSV`, `exportExpensesCSV`, `exportVendorsCSV`, `exportCheckinReport`, `resetAllCheckins`, `generateRsvpQrCode`
- `analytics.js` mount now subscribes to `expenses` + `vendors` store changes for budget chart
- Coverage thresholds raised: lines/functions/statements 70→80%, branches 60→70%
- Coverage `include` expanded to `src/**` (previously only `js/**`)
- CI workflow header updated to v3.1.0

### i18n

- Added keys: `guests_imported`, `confirm_delete`, `confirm_reset_checkins`, `export_expenses_csv`, `export_vendors_csv`, `export_checkin_report`, `reset_checkins`, `filter_by_category`, `budget_progress`, `budget_chart`, `import_guests_csv` (Hebrew + English)

### Tests

- Added 57 new tests in 2 new suites: **v3.1.0 New section exports** + **v3.1.0 src/utils pure functions** — total: **961 tests, 97+ suites**

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-27

### Breaking: ESM Entry Point Switch (S0.11 + S0.12)

- **S0.11 — Vite entry switched to `src/main.js`**: `index.html` now loads `src/main.js` instead of `js/main.js`. `vite-plugin-legacy-globals.mjs` plugin removed from `vite.config.js`. All `window.*` side-effect registrations eliminated.
- **S0.12 — ESLint simplified**: `varsIgnorePattern` reduced from 70+ prefix list to `^_` only. `js/` directory excluded from ESLint scope (legacy code). `lint:js` now covers `src/**/*.js`, `scripts/`, `vite.config.js`, `eslint.config.mjs`. `scripts/` override added for Node globals (`process`, `Buffer`) and `console.log`.
- **S0.11 — `src/main.js` rewrite**: Central bootstrap wires all ~50 `data-action` handlers via `on()` from `src/core/events.js`. Auth guard in `_switchSection` (public sections: rsvp, landing, contact-form, registry, guest-landing). Session rotation every 15 min.

### New Modules

- **`src/services/sheets.js`**: Added `syncSheetsNow()`, `sheetsCheckConnection()`, `createMissingSheetTabs()`.
- **`src/core/ui.js`**: Added `cycleTheme()`, `toggleLightMode()`, `toggleMobileNav()`, `restoreTheme()`.
- **`src/sections/settings.js`**: Added `clearAllData()`, `exportJSON()`, `importJSON()`, `copyRsvpLink()`, `copyContactLink()`, `saveWebAppUrl()`, `saveTransportSettings()`, `addApprovedEmail()`, `clearAuditLog()`, `clearErrorLog()`, `switchLanguage()`.
- **`src/sections/guests.js`**: Added `exportGuestsCSV()`, `setSideFilter()`, `printGuests()`, `downloadCSVTemplate()`.
- **`src/sections/tables.js`**: Added `printSeatingChart()`, `printPlaceCards()`, `printTableSigns()`, `findTable()`.
- **`src/sections/whatsapp.js`**: Added `sendWhatsAppAll()`, `sendWhatsAppAllViaApi()`, `checkGreenApiConnection()`, `saveGreenApiConfig()`.
- **`src/sections/registry.js`**: Added `addLink()` for registry URL management.

### Documentation

- **S7.5 — ARCHITECTURE.md**: Mermaid dependency graph showing all module relationships and data flow.
- **904 tests** (up from 899) — 5 new S0.11/S0.12 compliance tests verifying entry-point switch, ESLint ignores, and handler registration.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-26

### Sprint 3 — Sync & Offline Resilience

- **S3.3 — Optimistic UI**: `_guestPendingSync` Set in `guests.js`; `renderGuests()` marks rows with `data-sync-pending`; amber left-border + reduced opacity CSS in `components.css`; `clearGuestPendingSync()` called by `sheets.js` after successful flush.
- **S3.5 — Apps Script v2.0.0**: `sheets-webapp.gs` updated to v2.0.0 — `ALLOWED_SHEETS` now includes Vendors, Expenses, RSVP_Log; `deleteRow` action added; structured `{ ok, error, code }` error responses; `ensureSheets` creates all 6 tabs.
- **S3.9 — Offline-queue backoff**: `_MAX_RETRIES = 5`, `_RETRY_BASE_MS = 10_000`; failed items retried with exponential backoff (`2^retries × 10 s`, capped at 5 min); items exceeding retry limit are dropped silently.

### Sprint 4 — Quality Gates

- **S4.9 — Lighthouse thresholds**: `.lighthouserc.json` — severity upgraded from `warn` to `error`; performance raised to 0.90, accessibility to 0.95; `numberOfRuns: 2`, `throttlingMethod: simulate`, `preset: lighthouse:no-pwa`.

### Sprint 5 — DevOps & Protection

- **S5.4 — Branch protection**: `branch-protection.yml` workflow — weekly scheduled drift detection + manual apply job; uses `gh api` to verify required status checks, enforce_admins, disallow deletions.
- **S5.6 — Projects v2 automation**: `project-automation.yml` — auto-label via `actions/labeler`, auto-add to project board via `actions/add-to-project`, stale issue/PR management via `actions/stale`.
- **S5.10 — Deploy verification**: `deploy.yml` — post-deploy HTTP health check with 6 retries (exponential sleep); fails CI if site returns non-200 after all retries.

### Sprint 6 — Testing

- **S6.7 — Integration tests (DOM interaction)**: 57 new unit tests across 5 suites — offline-queue module, guest pending-sync, S3.3 CSS, branch-protection workflow, deploy verification, Lighthouse config assertions.
- **S6.9 — Visual regression**: `tests/e2e/visual.spec.mjs` — Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` coverage for desktop (1280×720), mobile (390×844), and all 4 themes; 2% pixel-ratio tolerance.
- **S6.11 — CI coverage gate**: Removed `continue-on-error: true` from CI coverage step — failing thresholds now block CI.

### Sprint 7 — Documentation & Release

- **S7.2 — CLAUDE.md v3**: Updated test count (804+), commands (`test:e2e` includes visual), critical gotchas for S3.3/S3.5/S3.9/S4.9/S6.9/S6.11 + quote-style gotcha.
- **S7.3 — copilot-instructions.md v3**: Version bump to 2.1.0; test count to 804+; E2E note includes visual regression (S6.9).
- **S7.6 — GUIDE.md**: End-user guide (Markdown) covering all tabs, RSVP flow, WhatsApp, offline mode, admin login, troubleshooting.
- **S7.7 — CHANGELOG v2.1.0**: This entry.

### Sprint 0 — ESM Migration Scaffold

- **src/utils/**: Named-export ES modules — `phone.js` (cleanPhone, isValidPhone), `date.js` (formatDateHebrew, daysUntil), `sanitize.js` (sanitize, sanitizeInput), `misc.js` (uid, guestFullName), `index.js` barrel.
- **src/core/**: `store.js` (storeSubscribe, storeSet, storeGet, initStore), `events.js` (initEvents, on, off), `config.js` (app constants), `i18n.js` (t, applyI18n, loadLocale), `state.js` (save/load/remove/clearAll), `dom.js` (el Proxy), `ui.js` (showToast, openModal, closeModal), `nav.js` (navigateTo, initRouter, initSwipe).
- **src/services/**: `sheets.js` (enqueueWrite, sheetsPost, sheetsRead), `auth.js` (loginOAuth, loginAnonymous, isApprovedAdmin, maybeRotateSession).
- **src/main.js**: Bootstrap entry skeleton (not yet Vite entry — migration ongoing).
- **Tests**: 33 new tests across 4 `src/` structure suites (837 total).

### Sprint 3–7 (batch 2) — Security, Testing, DevOps, Docs

- **JS: utils.js** — `sanitize(input, schema)` (S4.2): schema-driven validation for string/number/boolean/phone/email/url types; drops script injection patterns; returns `{ value, errors }`.
- **JS: nav.js** — `_initSwipe()` (S2.7): touchstart/touchend-based swipe navigation across the main section list; ignores vertical scroll intent.
- **JS: sheets.js** — `enqueueSheetWrite(key, fn)` (S3.2): last-write-wins debounced write queue (1.5 s debounce, coalesces per key); `_mergeGuest()` (S3.4) last-write-wins conflict resolution via `updatedAt`; `syncVendorsToSheets()` + `syncExpensesToSheets()` (S3.8); RSVP log append to `SHEETS_RSVP_LOG_TAB` (S3.7); pull-to-refresh (S2.8): 80 px touch drag triggers Sheets sync.
- **JS: config.js** — Added `SHEETS_VENDORS_TAB`, `SHEETS_EXPENSES_TAB`, `SHEETS_RSVP_LOG_TAB` constants (S3.7).
- **JS: guests.js** — `syncGuestsToSheets()` routed through `enqueueSheetWrite()` (optimistic UI S3.3).
- **JS: gallery.js** — `decoding="async"`, explicit width/height on gallery images for CLS prevention (S4.6).
- **JS: ui.js** — `openModal()` sets `aria-modal=true`, clears `aria-hidden`, stores `_modalOpener`; `closeModal()` restores focus to opener (S7.9 a11y).
- **Vite** — Manual chunk splitting (S4.5): `locale-en`, `chunk-analytics`, `chunk-gallery`, `chunk-services` via `rollupOptions.output.manualChunks`; stable asset filenames with hashes.
- **Scripts** — `generate-precache.mjs` (S4.4): scans `dist/` after build, writes `precache-manifest.json`, outputs ready-to-paste `APP_SHELL` array for `sw.js`.
- **Scripts** — `sri-check.mjs` (S4.3): enhanced to also scan `dist/assets/` and print SRI hashes for built output.
- **Workflows** — `preview.yml` (S5.7): PR preview deploys to `/preview/pr-{n}/`; auto-cleans on PR close; sticky PR comment with preview URL.
- **Tests** — 82 new tests (772 total, 83+ suites): utils (S6.2), store (S6.3), router (S6.4), sheets (S6.5), auth (S6.6), sanitize (S4.2), swipe (S2.7), sheets tabs (S3.7), bundle chunks (S4.5), PR preview workflow (S5.7).
- **E2E** — Playwright expanded (S6.8): RSVP flow, navigation flow, a11y smoke (3 new describe groups, 11 new tests).
- **Coverage gate** — Raised to 70% lines/functions/statements, 60% branches (S6.10).
- **README** — Architecture `mermaid` diagram (S7.1/S7.5); updated project structure; themes table; test count 772+.
- **copilot-instructions.md** — Updated test count, file list, key patterns (S7.4).
- **package.json** — Added `precache` script.

### Sprint 2-6 (batch 1) — UI Modernization, Backend hardening, DevOps, Testing, Security

- **JS: nav.js** — `_withViewTransition()` helper; section switches use View Transitions API with graceful fallback.
- **JS: ui.js** — `showToast()` rewritten with icon/message spans, `toast-progress` bar with CSS animation, click-to-dismiss, `toast-out` exit animation.
- **JS: dashboard.js** — `IntersectionObserver`-based stat card reveal (`stat-hidden` → `stat-visible`) via `_observeStatCards()`.
- **JS: sheets.js** — Polling replaced `setInterval` with `setTimeout` + exponential backoff (30/60/120/300 s) + ±10 % jitter; `updateSyncStatus(state)` drives `.sync-status` indicator; `stopSheetsAutoSync` and visibility handler updated to `clearTimeout`.
- **JS: auth.js** — Session rotation every 2 h via `_maybeRotateSession()` + 15-min `setInterval` on admin login; `_SESSION_ROTATION_MS` constant added.
- **GitHub DevOps** — Bug report + feature request issue templates; `config.yml` disables blank issues; enhanced PR template with subsection checklists; Dependabot npm weekly; CODEOWNERS expanded with security-critical files; CI release workflow now runs `npm run ci` before release + `prerelease` flag for beta/alpha tags.
- **Security** — `public/_headers` for GitHub Pages: security headers + immutable cache for assets + no-cache for SW/manifest; `npm audit` step in CI security-scan job.
- **Testing** — Vitest v8 coverage (`test:coverage`); thresholds: 60 % lines/functions/statements, 50 % branches; coverage step in CI.
- **README** — CI + deploy live status badges added.

## [2.0.0-beta.2] — 2026-07-12

### Changed — Architecture & SEO

- **CSS `@layer` cascade management** — 7 named layers (`variables`, `base`, `layout`,
  `components`, `auth`, `responsive`, `print`) with explicit order declaration in `variables.css`.
- **CSS native nesting** — Converted 7 selector families in `components.css` to `&`-based nesting
  (card, stat-card, search-box, guest-table, form-group, empty-state, bottom-nav).
- **SEO meta tags** — Open Graph (`og:title/description/url/image/locale/site_name`), Twitter Card,
  canonical link, robots directive, and JSON-LD `Event` structured data.
- **Lighthouse CI thresholds raised** — perf ≥ 0.85, a11y ≥ 0.9, BP ≥ 0.9, SEO ≥ 0.9, PWA ≥ 0.6.
- **Removed stale preload hints** — Dropped 5 JS + 2 CSS `<link rel="preload">` tags that target
  source files (useless after Vite bundling).

## [2.0.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-11

### Changed — v2.0 Migration (Sprints 0–1)

- **Sprint 0 — Vite 8 build** — ES module entry (`js/main.js`), `vite-plugin-legacy-globals.mjs`
  auto-registers top-level declarations on `window`, `base: '/Wedding/'`, deploy `dist/`.
  Vitest 4 test runner (537 tests), ESLint flat config (`sourceType: "module"`).

- **Sprint 1.1 — Reactive store** — `js/store.js` Proxy-based store with debounced
  auto-persist to localStorage and `storeSubscribe(key, fn)` API.

- **Sprint 1.2 — Event delegation** — `js/events.js` replaces 110 inline `onclick=`
  handlers with `data-action` / `data-on-input` / `data-on-change` / `data-on-enter`.

- **Sprint 1.3 — Kill innerHTML** — 35/36 innerHTML calls replaced with
  `document.createElement` / `textContent` / `DocumentFragment`.

- **Sprint 1.4 — Tighten CSP** — `script-src 'self' 'sha256-...'` (no `unsafe-inline`).

- **Sprint 1.5 — i18n split to JSON** — Hebrew and English translations moved from JS
  objects to `js/i18n/he.json` and `js/i18n/en.json`. Hebrew loaded eagerly via Vite
  static import; English lazy-loaded on first language toggle via dynamic `import()`.
  Separate 35 KB async chunk for English locale.

- **Sprint 1.6 — JSDoc @ts-check** — `// @ts-check` added to all 37 JS files.
  `tsconfig.json` with `checkJs: true` for IDE type checking. `@typedef` for Guest,
  SeatingTable, WeddingInfo, and enum types in `js/config.js`.

### Fixed

- **Vite plugin async function support** — `vite-plugin-legacy-globals.mjs` now matches
  `async function` declarations (previously only `function`). Fixes tree-shaking of async
  functions like `loadExternalConfig`, `subscribePush`, and all Sheets API functions in
  production builds.

### Infrastructure

- **Bundle**: 45 KB gzip main + 12 KB gzip English locale (lazy)
- **Tests**: 537 pass (71 suites)
- **Lint**: 0 errors, 0 warnings
